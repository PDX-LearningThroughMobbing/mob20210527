# Learning Through Mobbing


Driver: does all the typing
Navigator: Does all the deciding
Mob: Consults and discusses

Navigator: take us through each section

Recommended mobbing computer prep:

- Set notifications for Do Not Disturb
- Close all applications that you can
- Launch Xcode and login to GitHub
- Launch your simulator in advance

Rules (Add additional rules as a group):
    
- Be kind and supportive. Everyone is here to learn.
- Defer to the Navigator
- Have fun (this is a rule)
- Avoid backchanneling

## Mobbing Protocol
Agree to or change these durations, changes might have to be made in Mobster:

- Each turn at driver/navigator will be 7 minutes
- Weâ€™ll take breaks after 4 turns
- Those breaks will be 5 minutes long

## Project Description
Things we want to do (Capture the concepts people would like to work on or learn about tonight):
        
- Combine
- async - in a non url context 
- camera access

Project description (What we will do):

Single page app that transforms an image on tap - rotate

The transform must be perfomed on a background thread (aync)

If time allows, take a new picture with the camera. 

iPhone - SwiftUI



Come up with a simple (can be done in an hour and a half) project that hits as many of those concepts as possible.


What done looks like:
    
    
Discuss as a group how far into the project description we want to go, and any details that we likely want to hammer out in advance.
